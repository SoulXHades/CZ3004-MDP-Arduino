## Overview
In this project, a robot was developed to traverse an arena that contains walls, obstacle blocks, images attached to the obstacle blocks, the start zone, and the goal zone. The aim of the robot is to explore the arena, capture images, and race from the start to the goal zone through the fastest path. To develop such robot, hardware components such as an Arduino Uno, a Raspberry Pi, a 6-volt battery, power banks, DC motors with wheels, Infrared (IR) sensors, and a Raspberry Pi camera, is required.

In this page, we will only be introducing the foundation hardware components of the robot which are:
1. Arduino Uno
2. 6-Volt Battery
3. DC motors with Encoders
4. Infrared (IR) Sensors (Long and short range)

## Arduino Uno
The Arduino Uno was used as the microcontroller board in our robot, along with the Pololu Dual VHN5019 Motor Driver Shield mounted on top of it to drive the DC motors for its mobility (See Figure 2).
